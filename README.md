# XLRisk
XLRisk is an Excel addin for performing [Monte Carlo simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method).  It is **free and open source** and it is **compatible with Excel for the Mac**.  It works in a similar fashion to commercial addins such as [@RISK by Palisade](http://www.palisade.com).

*Note:*  
Excel 2010 or later required.  Excel 16 or newer is recommended.

## Features
* Free and open source
* Very easy to use
* Extensive simulation statistics and graphical output
* Implements the Latin Hypercube method for faster convergence and more accurate results
* Implements the [Iman-Conover method](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiFq8uzytHoAhVD2aQKHRF-AeMQFjADegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcran.r-project.org%2Fweb%2Fpackages%2FSimJoint%2Fvignettes%2FSimulatedJointDistribution.pdf&usg=AOvVaw15Y9i4xdH4tgpUrmOMDKSw) for generating samples from correlated distributions
