# XLRisk
XLRisk is an Excel addin for performing [Monte Carlo simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method).  It is **free and open source** and it is **compatible with Excel for the Mac**.  It works in a similar fashion to commercial addins such as [@RISK by Palisade](http://www.palisade.com).

*Note:*  
Excel 2010 or later required.  Excel 16 or newer is recommended.

## Features
* Free and open source
* Can be used with both Excel for Windows and Excel for Mac
* Very easy to use
* Extensive simulation statistics and graphical output
* Implements the [Latin Hypercube sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_hypercube_sampling) method for faster convergence and more accurate results
* Implements the [Iman-Conover method](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/STK4400/v05/undervisningsmateriale/A%20distribution-free%20approach%20to%20rank%20correlation.pdf) for generating samples from correlated distributions
